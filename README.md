Curve Project
===================
Curve Project is just a clone of Achtung die Kurve written in C++ and uses [SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML) so it is fast and simple. It was my first project in C++ and is therefore a big mess.

Build
-------
To build it look [here](http://sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.2/) on how to setup SFML.

To-Do List
----------------------------
* Clean up code
* Add AI
* Send linewidth to client(Sine powerup)
* Use same code conventions everywhere
* Add checks to check incoming data
* Prevent possible data races
* Wait until everyone is ready before starting countdown
* Ensure latest data is present when doing things like bomb
